# 📊 R DataQuest Portfolio

This repository contains all guided projects completed as part of the Data Analyst in R path on DataQuest. Each project demonstrates real-world applications of R for data analysis, visualization, and modeling.

## 🧠 Topics Covered

Throughout the program, I applied skills in:

* __R Programming__: Loops, conditionals, functions, and data types
* __Data Wrangling__: Using `dplyr`, `tidyr`, and base R functions
* __Data Visualization__: Creating plots with `ggplot2`
* __Data Cleaning__: Handling missing values, inconsistent types, and outliers
* __SQL in R__: Querying databases using `DBI` and `RSQLite`
* __Web Scraping & APIs__: Extracting external data using `rvest` and `httr`
* __Statistics & Probability__: Descriptive stats, hypothesis testing, and distributions
* __Predictive Modeling__: Linear regression, logistic regression, and model evaluation
* __Interactive Dashboards__: Built with **Shiny**

## 📁 Project Structure

Each folder includes:

* R scripts or RMarkdown files with full analysis
* Required data files
* Optional visualizations
* Project-specific README

## 🚀 How to Use
